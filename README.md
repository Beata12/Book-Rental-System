# Library Book Rental System

A simple Java-based console application for managing a book rental system. This project demonstrates basic object-oriented programming concepts, file handling, and usage of external libraries for JSON processing. It allows users to add books to a library, check the status of books (available or booked), book a book, return a book, and display all books or only available ones.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
